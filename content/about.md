Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hendra Manudinata**, usually called **Hendra**. I'm a student from Indonesia with interests in web development, embedded devices, as well as cyber security. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in [Information Technology](https://www.its.ac.id/it) at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id).

Iâ€™m also known as **@manoedinata** on the Internet. _manoedinata_ is actually my last name, but intentionally converted _from_ Indonesianâ€™s EYD (_Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan_, which translates to _Enhanced Spelling System_). Donâ€™t call me IRL with that username!

I tinker with Android, Linux, and a little bit of IoT & microcontrollers, but now I mostly work on web applications. Most of my projects are made FOSS and can be found here:
