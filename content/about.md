Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hendra Manudinata**, usually called **Hendra**. I'm a student from Indonesia with interests in web development, embedded devices, and also cyber security. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in [Information Technology](https://www.its.ac.id/it) at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id).

I tinker with Android, Linux, and a little bit of IoT & microcontrollers, but now I mostly work on web applications. Most of my projects are made FOSS and can be found here:

- <https://github.com/manoedinata>
- <https://gitlab.com/manoedinata>

I can be reached in the following places:

- LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoedinata>
- Telegram: [@manoedinata](https://t.me/manoedinata)
- Mail: [hendra@mdinata.my.id](mailto:hendra@mdinata.my.id)
- Matrix: @manoedinata:matrix.org

Fun facts:

- Iâ€™m also known as **@manoedinata** on the Internet. _manoedinata_ is actually my last name, but intentionally converted _from_ Indonesianâ€™s EYD (_Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan_, which translates to _Enhanced Spelling System_). Donâ€™t call me IRL with that username!
- I'm starting to dive deeper in _cyber security_, such as CTF competitions. In most cases, I'm known as **@ndrasukagacoan** or **@ndrasukadimsum**.
- Sometimes coffee makes me sleepy even more
- Hmm...
