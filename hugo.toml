I'm **Hendra Manudinata**, usually called **Hendra**. I'm a student from Indonesia with interests in web development, embedded devices, as well as cyber security. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in [Information Technology](https://www.its.ac.id/it) at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id).

I tinker with Android, Linux, and a little bit of IoT & microcontrollers, but now I mostly work on web applications. This GitHub page is where I store (almost) all of my works. Most of my projects are made FOSS and can be found in my [repositories](https://github.com/manoedinata?tab=repositories).

I'm also interested in robotics. I'm currently taking part as a programmer in [IRIS ITS](https://iris.its.ac.id), a research & development team for wheeled robot soccer competitions, such as [FIRA RoboWorld Cup](https://firaworldcup.org), [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org), and Indonesia's [Kontes Robot Indonesia](https://kontesrobotindonesia.id).
